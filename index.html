<!--    <h2>What is This Website?</h2>
-->

   <p>   
 This conference aims to share the most recent development in applied statistics, focusing on its applications in genomics, pharmaceutical research, and health data science. Invited speakers consist of academic and industry R&D researchers. 
  </p>
   <p>   
 Students are encouraged to present their work during poster session 6:00-9:00 on August 15. Travel awards are available for graduate students who present their work at first-come-first-serve basis.
  </p>
 <!--    <p>
For graduate students, this conference offers opportunities to learn the frontier of statistical research and important real-world problems from industry and helps them build the professional network for their future career. It also provides opportunities for students to share their work in the poster sections. It might lead to potential future opportunities for students' internships in the industry.
   </p>
    <p>
For researchers, besides sharing each other's recent research developments, this conference will bridge the gap between university research and industry R&D, which may lead to new collaborations on research motivated by solving real-world industry problems.    </p>
